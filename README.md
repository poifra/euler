Solving Project Euler, one problem at a time

Each .py file contains 10 Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) problems, except for euler_wip.py which contains the problems
I am currently working on.

The utils.py file is a collection of functions used in the euler_xyz.py files.

Some problems are missing because I was lazy and did them trivially in the Python CLI.
